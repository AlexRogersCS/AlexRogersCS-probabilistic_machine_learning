# Probabilistic Machine Learning

This is a short course on probabilistic machine learning using Python and PyMC. The course is focussed on the practical application of probabilistic modelling and most of the material is presented in Jupyter notebooks using Python.

Two books are particularly useful for this course:

* **Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers** by Cameron Davidson-Pilon. The is available as a printed book and a [website](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/).

* **Bayesian Analysis with Python** by Osvaldo Martin.

The notebooks for the course can be run using Google Colab. The Google Colab website supports the generation and running of Jupyter notebooks in the cloud and has all the necessary libraries installed. It may be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/).
